// Stacks can be built with arrays or linked lists
    // Depends on what sort of operations/priorities you would like to do 
    // Arrays allow cache locality which makes them faster when 
    // accessing items in memory bc they are right next to each other.
    // Linked lists are scattered all over memory.
    // Linked lists have extra memory associated with them  
    // bc we have to hold on to their pointers, but they do 
    // have more dynamic memory.

// Queues can be built with arrays or linked lists. 
    // More efficient to use linked lists
